\Large \textbf{What is a "filesystem"?}

\end{center}

\begin{flushright}

--- An organization of files into a system.

\end{flushright}

Why?

\begin{itemize}

\item Provide an illusion of a limitless number of limitless files.

\item Catalogue files into hierarchies and/or graphs.

\item Provide for long-term storage, without exposing the low-level mechanics
of the storage device(s).

\item Provide for fast access, despite the use of notoriously \emph{slow}
long-term storage devices(s).

\item Provide for durability in the face of power/user failures.

\item \ldots

\end{itemize}
